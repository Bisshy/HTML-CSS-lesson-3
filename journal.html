		<p>
			I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
		</p>
				
				<blockquote>
					Passing cars,<br>
					when you can't see,<br> 
					May get you,<br>
					A glimpse,<br>
					of eternity.
				</blockquote> 

		<p>
			I definitely won't be passing any cars.

			My First day of the trip! I can't believe finally got eveeything
			packed and ready tog o Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able 
			to bring a whole lot with me:

				<ul>
					<li>call Phone</li>
					<li>Ipod</li>
					<li>digital camera</li>
					<li>and a protein bar</li>
				</ul> 

			Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
			thousand miles begins with one Segway.<q>
